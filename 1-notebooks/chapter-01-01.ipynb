    "Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn from data. At its core, machine learning enables computers to identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The foundational principle of machine learning is to develop algorithms that can process large amounts of data, learn from this data, and then apply what they have learned to make informed decisions or predictions about new, unseen data.\n",
